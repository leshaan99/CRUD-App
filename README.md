# CRUD-App
I create a full-stack CRUD app using React, Node, MySQL, and Xampp. In this i using React to create the user interface, Node to handle the backend database operations, MySQL to store the data, and Xampp to serve the app. I'll also be using React Router to create dynamic routes, and Bootstrap to create a user interface.
